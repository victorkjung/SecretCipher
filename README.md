# Caesar Cipher Messenger

A Streamlit app for encoding and decoding messages using the Caesar Cipher. This app allows you and your friends to communicate secretly by shifting letters in your messages by a chosen number.

---

## Features
- **Encode Messages**: Convert your plaintext messages into secret code.
- **Decode Messages**: Decode your friend's secret messages back into plaintext.
- **Custom Shift Number**: Choose your own shift number (1‚Äì25) for added security.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design powered by Streamlit.

---

## How It Works
The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the message is shifted by a fixed number of places down or up the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3:
- `A` ‚Üí `D`
- `B` ‚Üí `E`
- `C` ‚Üí `F`
- ...
- `Z` ‚Üí `C`

Non-alphabetic characters (like spaces or punctuation) are left unchanged.

## How to Use
1. **Agree on a Shift Number**: You and your friend must agree on a secret shift number (e.g., 3).
2. **Encode Your Message**:
   - Go to the "Encode Message" tab.
   - Enter your message and click "Encode".
   - Share the encoded message with your friend.
3. **Decode Your Friend's Message**:
   - Go to the "Decode Message" tab.
   - Paste the encoded message and click "Decode".
   - Read the decoded message.
